研究生阶段开始接触实验室，每次都要穿上实验服白大褂，偶然的机会得知白大褂根据材质，实验性质会有不同的品质要求，于是想用这套设计阐述实验室白大褂的各种用途。

When I started to do my master degree, I got my own coat and was required to wear that whenever I entered the lab. Then I accidently knew that based on the experiment requirement, the material and function of lab coat varied a lot. On knowinig this interesting fact, I decided  to develope a graphic to illustrate different features of a lab coat.
