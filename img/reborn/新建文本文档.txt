Reborn is a set of flower pots made from newspaper. Through this design, I want to convey that life is eternel, and it keeps refreshing everyday. 

Firstly, I collected the waste newspaper and stick them together layer by layer with the glue.When the newspaper is dried out, it becomes as tough as wooden material.
Then I polished this special material to create Reborn.
