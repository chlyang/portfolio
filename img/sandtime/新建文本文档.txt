数据表明，社交恐惧症是3到8岁儿童心理病症中最为高发的病症。在公共空间，儿童群体会表现出攻击性以及自我防卫行为，这样的行为妨碍了儿童在社交环境正常与外界交流。从公共场所中的“等待”场景出发，Sand time是一个加强儿童在等待过程中互动的装置。儿童通过沙子与屏幕进行互动，在无意识中加强社会联系。

使用Arduino与Actionscript测试模型。

屏幕随沙子下落，触动传感器，产生上飘颗粒。

双人一起交互的时候，在两者中间的屏幕上会出现奖励，例如小鸟、苹果等，增加用户的联系。

Social phobia is a common mental disorder among children aged from three to eight years old. In public space, children tend to show aggressive and self-protection behaviors, which hinders the development of their communication skill. Start from a relatively subtle idea "waiting", this design targets users who is in a waiting queue, and aims at facilitating interaction among user group. In this project, children can play with sand to interact with the screen, then they can develop the potential to communicate. 

Use Arduino and Actionacript to test the prototype.

As the sand drops down, children can see particles generated in the screen.

When two children are playing together, they generate a "bonus object" such as apple, leaves and birds to strengthen connection.





Social disorder has been proved to take the highest rate of mental problem among children aged form 3-8. Children in public space usually show aggressive and self-protection, which hinders the development of their social communication ability. To facilitate the communication potential among children, Sand Time builds an immersive environment to help strengthen the connection between them.

Instead of face to face connection, Sand Time aims at developing the interaction in a more subtle and natural way. Inspired from sand playing scenario, Sand Time creates an area for children to interact and cooperate both in virtual and actual world, which helps children to emerge faster into the public environment.
