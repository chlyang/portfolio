一个关于刷子的小设计。其实这个设计起源于一个以刷子作为logo的服装公司，他们希望把logo品牌化，于是我就以刷子作为基本出发点，通过刷子阐述公司的理念。因为同时也很喜欢手绘的形式，就整体采用了蓝图与手绘风格设计。

设计中先展现了一把刷子应该具有的基本功能，接着是内部的构成与内涵。之后是这把刷子的各种附加价值。

A small design about brush. This design actually originates from a fashion company using brush as the branding logo, they wish to present the meaning of their logo. So I made use of brush as the basic element to illustrate the core idea of this company. 

This design firstly presents the basic function of a brush, then shows the inner structure and the meaning of company's core idea. The other funtions are also presented in the graphics.
