This design inspires from a poem of ¡¶stray bird¡· by Tagore: Let life be beautiful like summer flowers, and death like autumn leaves.

Life is short but also fantastic. It just exists, in different forms, and finally reaches the eternality.

The withering of a tree creates a pencil, and in this design, the pencil will present the grow process of a tree.
In the small details of sharpening a pencil, I endow the start and end of life, reminding people of the power of life, and make them cherish the life.

When we sharp the pencil, the scrap of the pencil will fall slowly like the leaves.I try to integrate into this design the ¡°sad and elapse¡± feelings of life, reminding people to cherish every details of life.
